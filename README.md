# About

This Repository is done for educational purposes. It is the first Project I did, which included JavaScript. I did it during the [Frontend Developer Program](https://edu.opencampus.sh/en/course/94) by [Open Campus](https://www.opencampus.sh) in Kiel. All of the Code, HTML and CSS is written by me. Some part I wrote following Tutorials and Courses. Nothing is just copy-pasted!

# Progress

This Project is far from being finished. Since it is not a realworld Project and I am advancing with the Learning of the React Framework, I decided to publish it although it is not finished. It should show my contemporary Understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There is still a lot of work planned - which could be seen by all the TODO and FIXME Tags.
